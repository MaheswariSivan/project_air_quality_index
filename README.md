# project_air_quality_index

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting air quality by analyzing key air pollutants and meteorological data retrieved via the European Environment Agency (EEA) API (*Data*: [EEA Air Quality API](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/apis), *API Documentation*: [EEA API Help](https://www.eea.europa.eu/help)). The primary pollutants considered include:

 - Carbon Monoxide (CO)
 - Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)
 - Ozone (O₃)
 - Particulate Matter (PM₂.₅ & PM₁₀)
 - Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)

Additionally, wind speed and direction data are incorporated to enhance prediction accuracy, as wind dynamics significantly influence pollutant dispersion.
To ensure modularity and ease of understanding, the project is structured into distinct phases, each addressing a critical component of the predictive modeling pipeline.
